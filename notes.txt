To Do-
	(1) Add double check in trainer_stats for duplicate entries to confirm that data is identical on tainer/date item.
	(2) If run_up_dist in .1 files is 250, need to check notes/comments to see if there's a longer run-up distance (250 is max on BRIS database, apparently).
	(3) Combine tables and put in consistency checking to confirm that info is consistent across these data sources.
	(4) In .6 data, need to combine all the comment snippets into a larger block. Not sure what the MYSQL datatype would be for that.
	(5) Add 'bullet' workout indicator.
	(6) Fix date data format.
	(7) Work on documentation.
	(8) Pull out QH races into separate DB
	(9) Pull out time_final == 0 races
	(10) pull out null entries for _1:_10 features.
	(11) add source file entry to tables to aid in tracking data issues back to original file.
	(12) date formatting for past_claim_trainer_switch_date (this field is a weirdo already... need to figure it out).



CTX0422.DRF-
	(1) row 20, past_claimed_code_1 was 'v'; changed to 'c'

LRL06172017.2-
	(2) row 7, trip_comment string was not quoted and had a weird quote mark in it.

Errata/Data issues:
	(1) race_general_results[84544]: AQU, 2006/12/16, race 8. Has weird distance of 1830.4. Maybe try to pull a PDF of race results.
