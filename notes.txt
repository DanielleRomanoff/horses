To Do-
	(1) Add double check in trainer_stats for duplicate entries to confirm that data is identical on tainer/date item.
	(2) If run_up_dist in .1 files is 250, need to check notes/comments to see if there's a longer run-up distance (250 is max on BRIS database, apparently).
	(3) Combine tables and put in consistency checking to confirm that info is consistent across these data sources.
	(4) In .6 data, need to combine all the comment snippets into a larger block. Not sure what the MYSQL datatype would be for that.
	(5) Add 'bullet' workout indicator.
	(6) Fix date data format.
	(7) Work on documentation.
	(8) Pull out QH races into separate DB
	(9) Pull out time_final == 0 races
	(10) pull out null entries for _1:_10 features.
	(11) add source file entry to tables to aid in tracking data issues back to original file.
	(12) date formatting for past_claim_trainer_switch_date (this field is a weirdo already... need to figure it out).
	(13) Should we pull out items where race_info.track != race_info.simulcast_track? If these races are already somewhere else, probably don't want to duplicate them.
	(14) The fraction times for some of the races is 0
	(15) Only look at TBs... separate out QHs
	(16) Flatten medication and equipment codes.
	(16.1) Flatten track conditions and surface types.
	(16.2) Flatten age/sex restrictions
	(16.3) flatten race_general_results race_restrictions
	(17) Beaten lengths seem to have 99.99 as an "out of range" entry.
	(18) Add jockey/trainer/owner additional info from horses_race_info table to jockey/trainer/owner tables.
	(19) Populate an all_horses db with breeding info, etc.
	(20) The .DRF program_post_pos seems to be null over entire data set.
	(21) best_BRIS_* in .DRF seems to have a lot of 0 values that maybe should be changed to NaNs in preprocessing. Check what's going on with this and maybe add a line to the preprocessor to address this.
	(22) in jockey_stats, it seems like the current meet record might be a lifetime record.
	(23) There are four entries in owner_stats that have owner and silks all null. Find out what's going on with this.
	(24) Add nonbetting flag to race_general_results (and probably delete it from the other table where it is. horses_race_info?)
	(25) In race_general_results, race_grade seems to have zero for nongraded races rather than NaN. Consider and correct.
	(26) Can the race_conditions_* fields be concatenated into a single field? Is there a blob type that can accomodate this?
	(27) There are some steeplechase races (run over National Fences)
	(28) I think breed should probably be moved from race_horse_info to race_info



CTX0422.DRF-
	(1) row 20, past_claimed_code_1 was 'v'; changed to 'c'

LRL06172017.2-
	(2) row 7, trip_comment string was not quoted and had a weird quote mark in it.

Errata/Data issues:
	(1) race_general_results[84544]: AQU, 2006/12/16, race 8. Has weird distance of 1830.4. Maybe try to pull a PDF of race results.
